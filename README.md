## Hi there, I am Luc! 👋

### 🔬 About Me  
I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the **Montreal Heart Institute** and the **University of Montréal**.  
My research explores the intersection of **health, physiology, and climate change** with a strong focus on vulnerable populations.  


### 🎓 Research Background  
- 🏋️ **Ph.D. Focus**: Health-related physical fitness and physical activity, with the implementation of cardiac rehabilitation programs for children and adolescents with inherited cardiac diseases.  
- 🔥 **Postdoctoral Research**: Investigating **heat exposure** and its **physiological and perceptual** effects on individuals with health and economic vulnerabilities.  
- 🌱 **Future Interests**: Studying physiological responses in **vulnerable infants and children** facing environmental stressors.  


### 🌍 Passion for Climate Change & Sustainability  
I am deeply interested in one of humanity’s greatest challenges: **climate change**. 🌡️🌎  
- **Research & Academia in the Climate Crisis**  
   🔹 How academic practices **may not align with climate action** and need to reduce its **carbon footprint**. 
    
- **My Personal Carbon Footprint**:  
   - 🌱 **2024**: 5.56 tCO₂e  
   - 🌱 **2023**: 3.80 tCO₂e  


### 🤝 Collaboration & Interests  
I’m looking to collaborate with anyone interested in:  
- **Human thermoregulation**
- **Cardiovascular responses** 
- **Climate change** & **heat vulnerability**  
- **Social inequities related to global warming**  
- **Sustainable research practices**  


🚲 Fun fact: **I bet any transportation can be done by bike!** 😄
